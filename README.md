# Shapes3D

Shapes3D is a simple 3D environment made up 3D figures. It is an environment for computer vision problems which can spawn different 3D shapes (e.g. spheres or boxes) in a simple 3D world and render the view from any point of view  using a pinhole camera model (i.e. intrinsic and extrinsic matrices). This environment resembles the environment from [Neural scene representation and rendering](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/neural-scene-representation-and-rendering) or GQN.
